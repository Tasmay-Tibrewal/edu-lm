is modified to account for the new data or the new observation. This iterative process eventually leads to a robust model.There is no need to oppose the Baconian and the Darwinian methods. Both have earned their place in Science.The Reality...: Scientific progress is almost never the result of strictly rational scientific methods. Intuition, non-rational and non-logical thinking make science fun, exciting and surprising. Einstein once said: "The only real valuable thing is intuition."... and also that ...

go further into a reasoning. For instance, assuming that the bottom photo is parallel to the stretching lineation (hypothesis), then one can infer that the sense of shear deduced from the "tiling" of K-feldspars in this orthogneiss is top to the right.A model is a self-consistent framework providing a coherent explanation for the observed facts. A model combines as many facts as possible and as little hypotheses as possible. A good model enables predictions to be made. A model is proven wrong if key predictions are not verified. It can be iteratively strengthened via minor modifications to account for both the facts and the predictions.A theory is a very robust model which accounts for a large number of independent facts; and whose numerous predictions have been verified over a long period of time. Evolution and Plate Tectonics are two scientific theories, Creationism is not.A law is a simple, fundamental concept that is always verified by experiments and that underpins our understanding of the world. For instance, the law of gravity and the laws of thermodynamics underpin our understanding of physics and chemistry.Truth is not a scientific concept.3

2025-06-10 18:13:26,228 - Query: Explain the difference between a normal fault and a reverse fault, including the stress regimes.
2025-06-10 18:13:26,228 -   Chunk 1 (Source: geology.txt, Page: 21):
A collection of block diagrams showing various types of faults and the orientation of the principal stresses (σ1​,σ2​,σ3​) that cause them.Normal Fault: σ1​ is vertical, causing the hanging wall to move down.Reverse Fault: σ3​ is vertical, σ1​ is horizontal, causing the hanging wall to move up.Sinistral (Left-Lateral) Strike-Slip Fault: σ2​ is vertical, blocks move horizontally to the left relative to each other.Dextral (Right-Lateral) Strike-Slip Fault: σ2​ is vertical, blocks move horizontally to the right relative to each other.Oblique-Slip Faults: Combination of dip-slip and strike-slip motion (e.g., "Normal sinistral").Rotational (Scissor) Fault: Displacement decreases to zero at one end of the fault.Listric Fault: A curved fault plane that is steep near the surface and flattens with depth.At the Earth's surface, one of the principal stress axes is always vertical because air is too weak to sustain a shear stress component. Hence, at the Earth's surface the stress regime is said to be Andersonian. It may come as a surprise that a fault with a slip direction oblique to the strike (for instance a normal sinistral fault) can form close to the surface. In fact, it can be shown (Bott, 1959) that for a given Andersonian state of stress (i.e. state of stress with one vertical principal stress axis) the orientation of the slip direction (i.e the striae) can have any orientation on a pre-existing fault plane, and this orientation is only a function of the relative magnitude of the 3 principal stress axes.20

the hanging wall moves down dip relative to the footwall. Normal faults dominates in the extensional tectonic regime (the maximum stress σ1​ is vertical).Reverse faults: the hanging wall moves up dip relatively to the footwall. Reverse faults are common in the contractional tectonic regime (the minimum stress σ3​ is vertical).Strike-slip faults (dextral or sinistral): the blocks move horizontally past one another.

A 3D block diagram illustrating the three main types of tectonic regimes and the faults they produce.Extensional Regime (left): Indicated by red arrows pointing away from each other. This creates a "Graben" structure, where a central block (green) drops down between two stationary blocks (yellow). This is a type of normal faulting.Contractional Regime (center, not explicitly shown but implied): Produces reverse faults.Transcurrent/Strike-Slip Regime (right): Indicated by red arrows pointing in opposite horizontal directions. This causes blocks to slide past each other horizontally.Faults: A fault is a fracture across which two blocks have slipped; the displacement of adjacent blocks is parallel to the fault plane. Faulting corresponds to the brittle failure of an undeformed rock formation or, alternatively, involves frictional sliding on a pre-existing fault plane. Faulting occurs when the maximum differential stress (i.e., maximum stress σ1​ minus minimum stress σ3​) exceeds the shear strength of an intact rock formation, or the frictional strength of a pre-existing fault.Fault types: There are three types of faults.Normal faults: the hanging wall moves down dip relative to the footwall. Normal faults dominates in the extensional tectonic regime (the maximum stress σ1​ is vertical).Reverse faults: the hanging wall moves up dip relatively to the footwall. Reverse faults are common in the contractional tectonic regime (the minimum stress σ3​ is vertical).Strike-slip faults (dextral or sinistral): the blocks

A map showing the state of stress for the Australasian and Southeast Asian region. This is from the World Stress Map project. The continents are shown in yellow, with plate boundaries marked by red, green, and blue lines. Across the map, there are small symbols representing stress data points. The orientation of the symbols indicates the direction of maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax​). The color of the symbol indicates the tectonic regime (e.g., NF for normal faulting, SS for strike-slip, TF for thrust faulting). The map shows a complex pattern, with compression generally oriented north-south to northeast-southwest across Australia, and more varied patterns around the plate boundaries.Interesting place to visit: http://www.world-stress-map.org33

A 3D block diagram showing a fault plane. On this plane, the total stress (σ) is resolved into two components: a normal stress (σn​), which is perpendicular to the fault plane, and a shear stress (τ), which is parallel to the fault plane and to the direction of slip (striae). The plane containing the stress vectors is the vertical plane in this diagram.Interactive 3.1 Stress is a couple of traction acting across a planeThe stress is decomposed into normal stress and shear stress...From experiments we observe that for a newly formed fault (i.e. developed from a fracture-less volume of rock):1/ σ1​, τ and σ3​ belong to the same plane. This plane is called the kinematic plane.2/ Shear stress and normal stress also belongs to the kinematic plane.3/ The slip vector on the fault plane is parallel to the shear stress.4/ The angle between the fault plane and σ1​ is close to 30°.When pre-existing faults exist, these faults may be reactivated when stressed. In the case of fault reactivation, one can observe from experiments that for a given fault orientation, and for a given state of stress defined by σ1​, σ2​ and σ3​:1/ The slip vector on the fault plane (i.e. direction parallel to the striae) is parallel to the shear stress.2/ The orientation of the shear stress depends on the orientation of τ, σ1​, σ2​ and σ3​ and R = (σ1​-σ2​)/(σ2​-σ3​).3/ It can be shown that for a state of stress stable in orientation, the striae can take any orientation on the fault plane depending on R (Bott, 1959).Therefore, one can infer from

Three diagrams illustrating the relationship between tectonic regimes, principal stress orientations, and the types of structures formed.COMPRESSION: σ3​ is vertical. This leads to reverse faults, vertical stylolitic joints (teeth pointing horizontally in the direction of σ1​), and horizontal extensional fractures.EXTENSION: σ1​ is vertical. This leads to normal faults, horizontal stylolitic joints, and vertical extensional fractures.TRANSCURRENT (STRIKE-SLIP): σ2​ is vertical. This leads to strike-slip faults, vertical stylolitic joints, and vertical extensional fractures. The horizontal orientations of σ1​ and σ3​ determine the type of strike-slip fault and the orientation of the vertical fractures.The determination in the field of the orientation in space of the paleostress ellipsoid responsible for the development of stylolites, fractures and faults is relatively easy. We have seen previously that there is a simple set of relationships between the orientation of the paleostress ellipsoid and the orientation of stylolitic joints, shear fractures and extensional fractures that develop in response to an applied stress.The sketch on the top right shows a set of microstructures that develop due to a tectonic regime in compression. From a stress point of view, a compressional tectonic regime is characterized by σ3​ being the vertical stress axis. From a strain point of view it is characterized by vertical stylolitic joints and horizontal extensional fractures. The stylolitic cones point in the direction of σ1​.

Image 1 (top): A map view diagram showing stress perturbation around a single left-lateral (sinistral) strike-slip fault. The regional stress field has σ1​ (compression) oriented top-to-bottom and σ3​ (tension) oriented left-to-right. Near the fault, the stress trajectories (red lines for σ1​, blue dashed lines for σ3​) are bent. The diagram also shows the expected orientation of associated structures like Riedel shears (curved yellow blades) and stylolites (jagged black lines), which also rotate near the fault.Image 2 (bottom left and right): Two map view diagrams showing stress perturbations in the "step-over" regions between overlapping strike-slip faults.The left diagram shows a restraining bend (compressional step-over) between two left-lateral faults. In the overlap zone, extensional fractures (yellow rectangles) and stylolites form, indicating local compression and extension directions that are different from the regional stress field.The right diagram shows a releasing bend (extensional step-over) where the opposite occurs.Image 3 (bottom): A photograph of a rock surface showing a network of fractures. It appears to be a real-world example of the complex fracturing that can occur in stressed rocks.Stress is transmitted through rocks without perturbation as long as the material through which stress is transmitted is mechanically isotropic. This is rarely the case in nature. Hence, the stress field changes, in both magnitude and orientation, in the vicinity of mechanical heterogeneities such as

A schematic cross-section of the Earth's continental crust from the surface down to the Moho (the base of the crust). The diagram illustrates the concept of "structural levels," showing how the style of deformation changes with depth.Top Level: Shows "Faults" and "Upright, isopach folds." The layers are gently folded.Middle Level: Starts with the "Schistosity front." The folds become tighter and more inclined ("Inclined, similar folds" and "Overturned, tight folds").Lower Level: Shows highly deformed rocks with "Metamorphic nappes and recumbent folds" and "Tectonic transposition, recumbent isoclinal folds." The fabrics are mostly sub-horizontal.The different levels are depicted with increasingly complex and intense deformation structures.Gallery 2.1 Structures and structural level.The concept of Structural Level is based on the observation that the style of deformation changes with depth due to changes in temperature and pressure (the product between density, depth and gravitational acceleration). With depth, strain becomes more pervasive, synchronous with metamorphism, and often leads to sub-horizontal strain structures and tectonic fabrics such as foliations and lineations.The Upper Structural Level (~0-15 km) is the domain of brittle deformation (faults & fractures), upright isopach folds, extensional fractures and stylolitic joints. Bedding is always recognizable.The Intermediate Structural Level (~10-25 km) starts at the schistosity front, where schistosity (also known as cleavage) begins to form. The

Bedding is always recognizable.The Intermediate Structural Level (~10-25 km) starts at the schistosity front, where schistosity (also known as cleavage) begins to form. The style of folding includes: similar folds, tight folds and overturned folds with a strong axial planar schistosity. Pressure solution is the dominant cleavage-forming mechanism. As water is released during prograde metamophism abundant quartz veins form, and Ductile deformation dominates over fracturing. Metamorphic grade does not exceed the greenschist to mid-amphibolite facies (~300 to ~600°C).In the Lower Structural Level (>~20 km) the style of deformation includes: metamorphic nappes, large scale recumbent folds and shallow dipping ductile shear zones. Deformation is intense and pervasive, tectonic transposition makes the mapping of early fabrics difficult if not impossible, fabrics are sub-horizontal. Metamorphic grades ranges from amphibolite facies to granulite facies (>600°C), and partial melting is often present.15

As a field-based discipline, structural geology operates at scales ranging from 100 microns to 100 meters (i.e. grain to outcrop).Tectonics aims at unraveling the geological context in which deformation occurs. It involves the integration of structural geology data in maps, cross-sections and 3D block diagrams, as well as data from other Geoscience disciplines including sedimentology, petrology, geochronology, geochemistry and geophysics. Tectonics operates at scales ranging from 100 m to 1000 km, and focus on processes such as continental rifting and basin formation, subduction, collisional processes and mountain building processes etc.Geodynamics focus on the forces that drive mantle convection, plate motion and deformation of Earth's material. Geodynamics is concerned with deep mantle processes such as mantle convection, cold drips, hot plumes and their links to plate motion, including dynamic plate subsidence and uplift, and plate tectonic processes.

Two diagrams illustrating the difference in foliation patterns between pure shear and simple shear zones.Top (Pure Shear): A localized zone of pure shear (coaxial deformation or "squeezing") is shown. Outside the zone, the marker lines are straight. Inside the zone, they are deflected to form a symmetric bulge, and the resulting foliation is parallel across the entire zone.Bottom (Simple Shear): A localized zone of simple shear (non-coaxial deformation) is shown. The marker lines outside are straight. Inside the zone, they are deflected into a sigmoid (S-shaped) curve. The resulting foliation is asymmetric and rotates into the shear plane.Across simple shear ductile shear zones, foliation trajectories are asymmetric, as foliation forms at an angle to the main shear plane. As shear strain accumulates, this angle decreases as the foliation becomes progressively parallel to the main shear plane. The angle between the foliation and the main shear plane is a kinematic criteria as it indicates the relative sense of shear.In a pure shear ductile shear zone, the foliation trajectories are parallel to each other across the shear zone, and remain parallel as strain accumulates through times.58

A gallery of images and diagrams explaining C-S fabrics.Top photograph: A sheared leucogranite showing a visible foliation. The caption indicates a shear strain (gamma) of ~1.Bottom diagrams: These illustrate the development of C-S and C-S-C' fabrics.C/S fabrics: In a shear zone, an early foliation (S-plane, for Schistosity) develops at an angle to the main shear direction. As strain increases, discrete C-planes (from the French 'Cisaillement' for shear) develop parallel to the shear zone boundary. The S-planes are curved between the C-planes, creating a sigmoid fabric that indicates the sense of shear.C/S/C' fabrics: At very high strains, the S-planes become nearly parallel to the C-planes. A new, secondary set of shear bands, called C'-planes, can form at a low angle to the main C-S fabric.C-S and C-S-C' shear fabrics - A class of kinematic criteria is based on the obliquity between the kinematic and the finite strain reference frames. Across a shear zone, the foliation - or S plane - (S for schistosity) rotates to parallel the shear plane - or C plane - (C for the french word cisaillement). As shearing increases the angle between S and C decreases (see below). This rotation is consistent with the kinematic of the shear zone i.e. a clockwise rotation of the S plane implies a clockwise sense of shear on the C plane.In the mylonitic core, where C and S are sub-parallel, a new generation of shear plane called C' may develop with a small angle (10-15°) to the C plane.

A photograph of a large, complexly folded rock outcrop. Several geology students are climbing on and examining the outcrop. The rocks are metamorphic and show tight, possibly refolded folds. The scene captures the hands-on nature of field geology.1/ What is the fold axis?2/ What is the axial trace?3/ What is the axial planar surface?4/ Draw an overturned, tight, isopach fold.5/ Draw an inclined, open, similar fold.6/ What is a recumbent fold?7/ What is a reclined fold?8/ What do we call a fold with long limbs and narrow hinges?9/ What is a crenulation cleavage?10/ What information do intersection lineations provide?Gallery 4.2 Mind the gap!Comment on the geometry of the folds (Photo Credit: P. Rey).47

Image 1 (left): An animation still showing the concepts of a fold axis (the line along the hinge) and the axial surface (the plane connecting the hinges of successive layers).Image 2 (right): A photograph of a coastal cliff with folded sedimentary rocks. The layers are clearly visible and bent into gentle folds. Two people are standing at the base of the cliff for scale.48

A close-up of a fault breccia. The rock is composed of angular, dark grey fragments (clasts) that have been broken and shattered during fault movement. The spaces between these fragments are filled with a white mineral, likely quartz or calcite, which has cemented the breccia together.1/ Define the following terms: a fact, an hypothesis, a model, a theory and a law.2/ Define the Darwinian scientific method.3/ A scientific model should always verify a number of characteristics. What are they?4/ How do stylolitic joints form?5/ What are the two main types of fracture?6/ Draw a stylolite / extensional fracture association and give the orientation of the principal stress axes.7/ What are the three main types of faults?8/ Describe the three modes of fractures?9/ Define the following concepts: a/ A listric fault. b/ The kinematic plane.10/ Define the following concepts: Vertical and horizontal throw, the heave, the net slip?The picture below shows a cemented breccia, it is the result of faulting. The rock crumbled into numerous angular clasts. A silica-rich fluid circulated through the fault zone precipitating quartz that cemented the clasts together.23

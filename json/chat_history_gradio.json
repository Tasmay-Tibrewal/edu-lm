The document details its focus on automated architectural discovery and the synthesis/orchestration of diverse reasoning strategies, intended for AI researchers, developers, and for the system's own continuous improvement.\n\n2.  **`Tasmay_P_Tibrewal_CV_Final_1.1 1.pdf`**: This document is the Curriculum Vitae (CV) of **Tasmay Pankaj Tibrewal**. It highlights their research work (e.g., LLMs for Hardware Design, custom tokenization algorithms), achievements in various AI/ML competitions (e.g., Sarvam AI, Inter IIT Technology Meet), professional internships (e.g., WorldQuant, Ernst & Young, Tata Steel), and other experiences including founding a B2B AI SaaS platform (Zyke) and notable academic achievements.",

I am a third year undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur and the document that you have is a research consultant on boarding confirmation and I am applying for an internship at a place. So for this, for that internship, I need to have some CV pointers regarding my profile. So my profile is in AI and machine learning. And I have had experience in quantitative finance. And I've worked at WorldCount. I have been ranked top two in my college, which is IIT Kharagpur. and about top 200 across the world right and i have had building alphas and i have had total more than 50 000 points participated in the international competitions like iqc which is international corn championship hosted by world corn right and i had clear the first level as well right and had gone to the second level of the competition and yeah so basically world is a international quantitative finance firm holding assets of i like having assets under management of about nine billion dollars and it is part of millennial fund i guess right so millennial fund or millennial capital or something like that millennium capital maybe right so yeah that is mostly all the information other than that I have had I have had work experience at Harvard University as a research intern I have had worked in various national level hackathons and competitions like internet technology meet well point oh I worked there and we work there on a problem statement given to us by a startup called DevRev So we worked on the problem statement which was related to basically tool use in large language models So we worked on iterative, conditional, multipath, then optimal tool usage by fine tuning and improving the performance of large language models. right so these models were quite well trained to match the performance with the comparable to the closed source model on of that time on tool usage tasks right so these models included models like uh uh code llama or llama 2 right and deep seek 1.7 b right and uh yeah that was entirety then i participated in smart india hackathon which is national hackathon where i was national finalist we worked on identifying uh we worked on a fraud detection problem statement where we uh try to identify medical invoices for fraud detection right so basically people would try to defraud the insurance agencies by manually editing or creating fake medical invoices so we try to detect that from the real ones using template matching then techniques like GANs or even vision language models right so that it could be the areas could be segmented and a flagging system we had built which flagged these particular things as chances of high probability of frauding or low probability of frauding right.",
